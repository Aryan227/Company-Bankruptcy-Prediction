# Company-Bankruptcy-Prediction
ML project made for my Machine Learning elective

Problem Statement:
Building a Machine Learning model to predict if a company will go bankrupt on the basis of various financial parameters

Steps used:
1. Perform EDA on the dataset and clean it
2. Remove outliers from the dataset to increase model efficiency
3. Perform Train-Test split
4. Analyze the most important parameters
5. Build multiple ML models using SMOTE (as data is imbalanced) and get accuracy and F1 scores
6. Select the best model using ROC and confusion matrix
7. Predict the target values for test set and check classification report.

Current F1 score: 0.42
